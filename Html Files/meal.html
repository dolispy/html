        <h1>My Favorite Meal</h1>
        <p>Of the creative dishes in the World, it's hard to pick a favorite. I finally settled on the one meal that I can never get tired of regardless of the weather/season and that honors goes to pancakes; most particularly, <strong>Fluffy Pancakes</strong></p>
        <h2>Origin of Pancakes</h2>
        <p>Most people think Pancakes originated from the United States, interestingly, that is not the case as the earliest mention of Pancakes came from The Ancient Greeks which were called τηγανίτης (tēganitēs), ταγηνίτης (tagēnitēs) or ταγηνίας (tagēnias),all words deriving from τάγηνον (tagēnon), "frying pan".
         Tagenites were made with wheat flour, olive oil, honey, and curdled milk, and were served for breakfast. So, <strong>what is a Pancake? </strong> <br>
         A pancake (or hot-cake, griddlecake, or flapjack) is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often frying with oil or butter. It is a type of batter bread. </p>
