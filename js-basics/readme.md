<b>Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynmaically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category</b>

<p>Statically typed languages
A language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time. For some languages, this means that you as the programmer must specify what type each variable is. The main advantage here is that all kinds of checking can be done by the compiler, and therefore a lot of trivial bugs are caught at a very early stage.
Examples: C, C++, Java, Rust, Go, Scala</p>

<p>Dynamically typed languages
A language is dynamically typed if the type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc. This means that you as a programmer can write a little quicker because you do not have to specify types every time (unless using a statically-typed language with type inference).
Examples: Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Erlang</p>


<b>Differentiate between the JavaScript data types 'null' and 'undefined'.</b>
<p>
Undefined is a type that has a variable declared, but no value has been assigned/<p>

<p>Null, on the other hand, is an assignment value that can be assigned to a variable.</p>
